            <p>
                When I was younger, I really wanted a pet fish. My first pet, unfortunately, didn't survive long because I was steered astray by the PetCo Employee. I don't have any 
                photos of that old tank, but I remember it being far too small for the fish I had. I ended up with a 1 US gallon (3.78L) tank, housing a long-fin Betta and a 
                single Danio rerio. The filter on my tank was rather small and barely sufficient, although it did help dissolve oxygen into the water. The tank had a basic 
                hang-on-back filter, two artificial plants that caused damage to the Betta's scales, and some cheap rainbow gravel that I didn't pay much attention to.<br>
                
                About two weeks into owning the tank, the Betta attacked the Danio rerio overnight, resulting in the Danio's death. When I found the dead fish the next morning, 
                my mom told me to fish it out with a net and flush it down the toilet, without mentioning the need for a water change. Unfortunately, the 
                Betta didn't fare much better and passed away after enduring the tank's conditions for another two and a half months. An ammonia spike from decomposing food 
                and a seven-hour power outage that stopped the filter contributed to its demise.<br>
                
                Now, over five years later, I'm returning to the hobby to redeem myself and create a well-maintained, visually appealing aquarium without causing any harm to 
                the fish. I'm determined to do things correctly this time around.<br>

                The first day of the new tank started slow. I had just returned from a local fish store where I head purchased it. 
                I unboxxed it, put it on a sturdy old storage cabanet. I put the filter media in and set up the pump, then left it for a few days as my 
                substrate had not yet arriaved. After about three days, my sand and aquasoil arriaved. I quickly filled the bottom of the tank with aquasoil then capped 
                it with the sand. I then began filling the tank but my mom made me stop. She made me pick the tank up and put it on my bed, then lift the stand so she could  
                put down a mat. once the mat was in place, I moved the stand and tank back into place, then re-flattned the sand and aquasoil that had gotten shifted arround 
                from the process. This caused the aquasoil to be scattered arround the sand instead of nicely consealed, but I like the new look better. Finaly, I could continue filling, 
                one pitcher at a time. Add a little water conditioner, fill the pitcher, and pour into the tanks filter compartment to not shift the sand too much.<br>
                
                After letting the filter run for a few days, I tested the water. No chlorine or toxic metals. Perfect. I got a few plants and a cool rock. 
                I scaped the tank, placeing the rock in the center, some plants behind it, one in the far left and one to the right in front of the rock. 
                After a few days, the palnts appeared to have rooted in somewhat and didnt welt too much. A week later, I convinced my mom to go to lowes and get a five gallon bucket. 
                After getting the bucket, we went the local fish store in my area, and discussed what would work good in a 16 US gallon (60.56L) tank. I looked at many fish, and decided to get 
                six Gold White Cloud Minnows (Tanichthys albonubes) as I loved their gold body and red fins. When checking out, I also got some airline tubing, to drip aclimate the fish. 
                After getting home with my new babies, I quickly but carefuly put them in my five gallon bucket and started a small siphon using the airline tubing, about 3-5 drips per second. 
                I let the fish aclimate for two and a half hours before netting them and releasing them into their new home. As they began to explore their new tank, I just watched from my bed, witch faces the tank. 
                The fish looked so good with the plants and rock.<br>

                The next day, I woke up to only find two fish in the tank. I looked everywhere, under the tank, in the cabanit, and all arround the room. 
                I then had the idea to look in the filter, and found four fish, trapped. They had swam into a small hole for balancing water levels and got stuck 
                in the filter! I grabbed my net, and got them out and into the main tank again then added some benafical bacteria. After about an hour, I desided to feed them for the first time. 
                They quickly went after the food once I had dropped it in. I then did a water test and ammonia was a little high, as I desided to do a fish-in cycle. 
                I took my waterchange cyphon, and began to suck out about four gallons of water, then topped the tank back up with tap water I added some water conditioner to detoxify it.<br>

                The next day, I had to repeat the same thing, get the fish out of the filter, do a waterchange, add benafical bacteria, and top up the water. 
                I had to keep doing this for about a month and a half but about two weeks after it started, one of the fish got stuck to the pump and ended up dying. 
                about twenty days into having the fish in the tank, 
                I also got floating plants to help. throught the weeks, most died off from a lack of nutrants, but once the cycle completed, they began taking over 
                the surface of the water. They multiplied so fast that within two weeks of the tanks cycle completing, they had almost fully covered the surface. 
                I ended up getting a portal to make an open area to feed the fish, as they were having a hard time finding the food and it was 
                annoying to remove the lid and drop food in only to replace it seconds later instead of just dropping some food in the feeding hole.<br>

                Nothing much changed in the tank for the next month or so, other than the expected alge bloom. the fourth month, I desided to get 
                some snails. However, while drip aclimating them, my siphon stopped, causing them to die. I still tried to save them by adding them anyways, 
                though it has not worked out. They have not put their foot down and their shells started turning white.<br>

                Before getting the snails, some of my fish gave birth!
