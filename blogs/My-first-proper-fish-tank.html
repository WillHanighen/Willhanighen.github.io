            <p>
                When I was younger, I really wanted a pet fish. My first pet, unfortunately, didn't survive long because I was a careless young boy. I don't have any 
                photos of that old tank, but I remember it being too small for the fish I had. I ended up with a 1 US gallon (3.78L) tank, housing a long-fin Betta and a 
                single Danio rerio. The filter on my tank was rather small and barely sufficient, although it did help dissolve oxygen into the water. The tank had a basic 
                hang-on-back filter, two artificial plants that caused damage to the Betta's scales, and some cheap rainbow gravel that I didn't pay much attention to.<br>
                
                About two weeks into owning the tank, the Betta attacked the Danio rerio overnight, resulting in the Danio's death. When I found the dead fish the next morning, 
                my mother simply instructed me to fish it out with a net and flush it down the toilet, without mentioning the need for a water change. Unfortunately, the 
                Betta didn't fare much better and passed away after enduring the tank's conditions for another two and a half months. An ammonia spike from decomposing food 
                and a seven-hour power outage that stopped the filter contributed to its demise.<br>
                
                Now, over five years later, I'm returning to the hobby to redeem myself and create a well-maintained, visually appealing aquarium without causing any harm to 
                the fish. I'm determined to do things correctly this time around.
